How to play a CONGRESSIONAL SIMULATOR:

Compile all java files

Run Driver.java

You will be presented with information regarding the Senate,
then be prompted to make a choice regarding your State.
Please remember to always capitallize the first letter of each word, unless a word is quoted otherwise.
You will then be presented with information regarding your state and the world.

After this the cycle begins and thou shall have to attempt to navigate
the vast halls of the Senate by responding to the prompted legislation and events, 
hoping to survive, all the while as lost (maybe) as a fresh intern on the hill.
